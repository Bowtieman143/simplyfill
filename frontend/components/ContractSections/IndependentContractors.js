            The Service Provider agrees that all Services will be performed by
            the Service Provider as an independent contractor and that this
            Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship between
            the Service Provider and the Client. The Service Provider shall have
            no right to receive any employee benefits provided by the Client to
            its employees. The Service Provider agrees to pay all taxes due in
            respect of the Service Fee and to indemnify the Client in respect of
            any obligation that may be imposed on the Client to pay any such
            taxes or resulting from the Service Providerâ€™s being determined not
            to be an independent contractor. This Agreement does not authorize
            the Service Provider to act for the Client as its agent or to make
            communications on behalf of the Client.
