            This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and be subject
            to the laws of the [your state if in you’re in the US or your
            country]. All court proceedings relating to or arising out of this

            The Parties agree to attempt to settle any dispute arising out of or
            relating to the Agreement amicably, before commencing any court
            proceedings, which includes mediation and/or arbitration.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the mediation fails, then the Parties will attempt jointly to
            make a written record of those matters (if any) relating to the
            dispute which have been agreed to by them, for submission in any
            later arbitration. The mediator’s role will cease, at the latest,
            upon commencement of any arbitration proceedings. The mediator will
            not be available to appear as a witness in the arbitration, nor to
            provide any additional evidence obtained during the mediation. The
            Parties agree that their good faith in conducting any mediation
            proceedings is a condition to pursuing any other legal or equitable
            remedy which includes litigation, arbitration or other dispute
            resolution procedures.

            Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this dispute which
            cannot be settled in accordance with section 14.2 above, shall be
            settled in accordance with the rules of arbitration by one or more
            arbitrators in accordance with the said rules.
